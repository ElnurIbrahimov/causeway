Assume this is a lightweight causal substrate that can be bolted onto any Transformer without retraining the base model, and whose job is only one thing: answer "if X were different, what would change?" approximately but reliably. The name should reflect local causality, counterfactual deltas, and non-omniscience. It must not claim full world simulation. It must sound like infrastructure, not intelligence. A strong, clean name for this is Causeway. Causeway works because it denotes a narrow, structured path across otherwise disconnected states. That is exactly what this module is: a constrained bridge between an observed state and a nearby hypothetical state. It does not predict the future; it estimates causal displacement. It does not reason globally; it operates locally. It does not replace the Transformer; it sits beside it. Formally, Causeway would be described as a Lightweight Counterfactual World Interface. Operationally, the Transformer produces a candidate action or decision. Causeway takes the current state representation plus that action, perturbs only the relevant variables, and returns a delta vector describing what would likely change if the action were taken versus not taken. The output is not text. It is structured: shifts in goals, risks, constraints, resource usage, success probability. The Transformer then conditions its next step on that delta. This avoids the core failure mode of Transformers, which is mistaking correlation for intervention. Transformers are excellent at describing what usually follows X. Causeway is designed to approximate what would happen because of X, under intervention. Even if the approximation is crude, it moves the system from imitation to causal control. The key architectural insight is that Causeway does not need to be large. It does not model the full world. It only models action-adjacent causality. Most useful counterfactuals are local: "if I do this instead of that, what breaks, what improves, what risks increase." You do not need planetary simulation to answer that.
